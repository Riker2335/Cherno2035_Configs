# Cherno2035_Configs
Random bits of specific config for the Cherno 2035 server

loot_positions.cpp can just be copied/pasted into your exile_server_config/config.cpp file. Just be aware that this was setup for my own server which has custom loot table categories. So, please adjust things like "MilitaryHigh" and "CivilianUpperClass" to whatever is appropriate for your own server.
